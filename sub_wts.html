							<!--<p>This is a <strong>Spotlight</strong> element, and it's generally used &ndash; as its name implies &ndash; to spotlight a particular feature, subject, or pretty much whatever.

                            <h3>Background</h3>
							<p> 
							<br><em>Emergency situation and accidents may occur at any time. </em>Injuries take lives of
							about <strong>4,000,000</strong> people every year worldwide, However <strong>59%</strong> of deaths from injuries
							would have been preventable had first aid been given before the emergency
							services arrived. 
							<br>First aid is therefore a humanitarian act that should be accessible to all; with first aid skills volunteers and communities are empowered to save lives without discrimination. In case of accident it is important to take correct action timely. <br>However in developing countries probability of finding some one who has been trained for this purpose or who has the skills to perform an action is very low.

							<br>Through gamification of 1st Aid practices we would like to out reach more people efficiently and take a big step to realize Red Cross vision:

 							<i>“In the Red Cross, we all have a vision of society where we all have lifesaving skills, the confidence and the willingness to act and to step forward to help someone in a crisis. A society where everyone is ready to save a life, not just the trained few”.</i></p>


<h3>Some Facts</h3>
<p>
	We discovered current 1st aid trainings are not entertaining & engaging and in most of cases they are forgotten very fast, so individuals can NOT take correct action when it is required. The misinformed at a higher rate would take wrong action which may worsen the situation of the injured.  Healplus would like to save lives with simple actions but effective and important and in a timely manner, Specially at homes and schools where accidents and first aid are frequently experienced. Needless to say youth can play an active role and take a big step to improve the condition of injured.

	<br>Play based learning proved to foster results of education. Some of advantages are :
	<br>-  To develop empathy through play as children learn about the feelings, emotions and motivations of others;
	<br>- Engage children in dramatised play to demonstrate ways of caring and showing empathy.
	<br>-Brings joy as children share these social experiences with friends
	<br>- Develops a sense of belonging to a community

	<br>Gamification of 1st Aid can be used as a supporting material of official training and a tool to connect students and experts through the game. We hope to increase awareness and Reduces susceptibility to accident.

	<br>The game will cover 5 areas of 1st aid ( Concussion, burns, bleeding, choking and shock) and in addition will cover snake bite and bicycle accident. The game offer different environment like village , big city, outdoor etc so that one have a choice based on their life style. In addition player can log in with their ID to build a personal connection with game
